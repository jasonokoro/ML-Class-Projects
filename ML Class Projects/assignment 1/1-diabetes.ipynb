    "**Learning objectives.** You will:\n",
    "1. Train and test a linear model using ordinary least squares regression. \n",
    "2. Apply regularization, specifically LASSO, to build a sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code will download and preview three examples of the data. The ten features are as follows (in order):\n",

    "- bmi body mass index\n",

    "\n",
    "Your overall goal in this part is to build and evaluate a linear model to predict the target variable `y` as a function of the ten features in `X`, and to identify which features are more significant for predicting `y`."
