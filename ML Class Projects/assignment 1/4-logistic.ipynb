    "## Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following class to implement binary logistic regression. Some important notes about the implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remember that the Scikit-Learn API treats an input `X` array, whether to `fit` or `predict`, as a matrix with a row for every data point and a column for every feature. \n",
    "2. For `fit`, every row in `X` corresponds to a given output in `y`, and  you don't need to return anything, just optimize the internal model weights (which should be stored as instance variables). For `predict_proba` and `predict`, you should return a NumPy array with one element (corresponding to a probability or a 0/1 value) for every row in the input `X`.\n",
    "3. Remember that logistic regression models the probability of outputting `1` as a sigmoid of a linear function of features. This has several implications. One is that the number of weights in your model should equal the number of features equal to the number of columns of the `X` matrix passed to the `fit` method. We recommend that you initialize these weights as random normally distributed values, for example by using NumPy's [random.normal](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html). Another implication is that `predict_proba` should return the sigmoid activation of the [dot product](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html) (multiply element-wise then add together) of your model's weights and the given input. You do **not** need to include a bias term for this implementation.\n",
    "4. For the `predict` function, you should use a simple thresholding of 0.5. That is, you should calculate the probabilities using the `predict_proba` method and return `1` if the probability is greater than 0.5 and `0` otherwise. You can assume that `y` will consist exclusively of `0`s or `1`s for the purpose of this implementation.\n",
    "5. The `fit` method should implement gradient descent on the log-likelihood. For a given feature/weight dimension $j$ and a particular data point $x$ with label $y$, the partial derivative with respect to weight $w_j$ is $(a - y)x_j$ where $a$ is the activation (the predicted probability) assosciated with example $x$. For each feature, this quantity should be averaged over all training data. The vector of all such values forms the gradient $\\vec{\\nabla}$. The gradient descent learning update should then be $\\vec{w'} = \\vec{w} - \\eta \\vec{\\nabla}$ where $\\eta$ is the learning rate `lr` passed to the constructor, $\\vec{w}$ are the previous weights and $\\vec{w'}$ are the weights for the next iteration. The algorithm should proceed for `iters` iterations.\n",
    "6. You will note the `fit` method takes an optional `verbose` parameter. While it is not required, we highly recommend that you include code in the `fit` method that, when `verbose` is `True`, provides additional logging or printing of information about the training process to help debug. \n",
    "7. The `pass` statements are syntactic placeholders that should be removed when you implement a method.\n",
    "8. Finally, note that your implementation will be much more efficient if you use vectorized NumPy operations and avoid for loops or nested for loops over large amounts of data."
