    "# Part 5: LLM Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no programming in this part of the assignment. Instead, this part is about reading an influential paper on the possible risks and dangers of large language model training and deployment from a human and societal perspective. You will respond briefly to several reflection questions.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this exercise, you will:\n",
    "1. **Read** about the possible societal risks of large language models. \n",
    "2. **Interpret** these risks and **articulate** your own view.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, read the 2021 article [*On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Shmargaret Schmitchell."
