# ML-Class-Projects
This repository contains assignments and projects for my Applied Machine Learning class. All work is presented in Jupyter Notebook format.

## Topics Covered
- **Supervised Learning:** Linear regression, logistic regression
- **Deep Learning:** Feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
- **Advanced Architectures:** Transformers and large language models (LLMs)
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Policy-based and value-based learning algorithms
- **Model Evaluation:** Cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and performance metrics

Each notebook in this repository corresponds to a specific assignment or project and demonstrates the practical application of these machine learning concepts using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
